# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-07)

**Core value:** A developer can see exactly what every AI agent is doing across their codebase in real time, prevent destructive conflicts between concurrent agents, and approve/deny agent actions from a single command center.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — Conflict Resolution + History

## Current Position

Phase: 05
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-11

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

-

- [Phase 05]: Used Map copies for immutable resolution state in conflictStore merge actions
- [Phase 05]: Used Map for contentionScores in radarStore; extended StatusBadge with 8 new variants for history tables
- [Phase 05]: Consolidated immediate + periodic contention score updates into single useEffect; StatusBadge resolved variant reused from Plan 04

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW buffer overflow under agent burst writes needs empirical testing
- Phase 2: PID-to-file-event correlation on Windows may need ETW investigation
- Phase 3: Conflict window data model has no existing reference implementations
- Phase 5: 3-way merge UI complexity -- study GitKraken, VS Code merge editor for patterns
